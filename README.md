## 🎯 What is This?

This firmware enables **synchronized multi-room audio** on the [FutureProofHomes Satellite1](https://futureproofhomes.net/) voice assistant hardware using **Sendspin** - a next-generation ESPHome audio synchronization protocol. Perfect for whole-home voice control and perfectly synchronized music playback across multiple rooms.

### Key Features

✅ **Sendspin Multi-Room Audio** - Play music in perfect sync across multiple Satellite1 devices
✅ **Home Assistant Voice Assistant** - Full integration with Home Assistant's local voice control
✅ **ESPHome Dashboard Support** - Easy adoption and automatic updates
✅ **Presence Detection** - Optional LD2410/LD2450 radar sensor support
✅ **Power Optimized** - Smart DAC power management for reduced energy consumption
✅ **Professional Hardware Drivers** - Optimized TAS2780, PCM5122, and FUSB302B drivers

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**This is experimental firmware under active development.**

- ❌ **Not production-ready** - Expect breaking changes and updates
- ❌ **No Snapcast support** - This fork uses [Sendspin](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/12284) instead
- ✅ **For Snapcast users** - Please use the official [FutureProofHomes firmware](https://github.com/FutureProofHomes/Satellite1-ESPHome)
